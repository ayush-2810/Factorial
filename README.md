# **Factorial**  

**Factorial_in_O(n)** : This file contains an **iterative way** of calculaitng the factorial of a number.  
                    Time complexity : **O(n)**  
                    
**Factorial_1_in_O(n)** : This file contains a **recursive way** of calculating the factorial of a number.  
                    Time complexity : **O(n)**  
                    
**Fastest_factorial** : This file contains the **fastest** way of calculating the factorial of a number.  
This uses the in built function **factorial** which is present in **math** module in the python.
